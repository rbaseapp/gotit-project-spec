# 28 — GotIt UX 2.1 DEV implementation and release gate

## Source and status

- Source repository: `gotIt-front`, commit `a535a880c3ee8746ebb49d65ce714ed0fcfd8a70`.
- Branch: `feat/ux-2-1-dev`; DEV-only owner instruction overrides app-main/production delivery.
- Status: implemented and locally verified; **not deployed**. Production source/services/data were not changed by this task.
- Report/route coverage is below. Design-only proposed capabilities are explicitly excluded from active-server claims.

## Local verification

`npm.cmd run check` passed typecheck, lint, **206 Vitest tests**, build and **17 gateway tests**.
`npm.cmd run test:responsive -- --workers=4 --reporter=json` passed **391/391** cases with no failures/skips/flaky cases.
Tests use API and Realtime event fixtures. No real provider, microphone, billing or DEV product mutation was tested.
Build retains the existing large-main-chunk and Zod annotation warnings. Physical devices, screen readers and production acceptance were not run.

## Operational inspection (read-only, 2026-10-05)

| Surface | Evidence | Release consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DEV Web `srv-dar6dng473hc73a0ns1g` | Source still `main`, live `da913168f85baddc844978412058cf888117e85c`; proxy targets are DEV Core/Backend, public origin `https://gotit-dev.rbaseapp.com` | Select only the DEV branch after backend isolation; no production-main push. |
| DEV Backend `srv-dar6ei7f3r2c73balbp0` | DATABASE_URL points to production host `dpg-dagov2pt0dsc73a37me0-a`, database `rbase_core_db`, role `gotit_runtime` | **Block product writes and this release deployment** until retargeted and verified. |
| DEV Core `srv-dar6gp942hec73d6b8bg` | Separate host `dpg-dar6fkp7lnhs73a7mspg-a`, database `gotit_dev`, existing role `gotit_dev_user` | Isolated DB target confirmed; credential/privilege was not changed. |
| Separate DEV database | Prior migration catch-up and unverified direct runtime login are recorded in [operations](10_OPERATIONS.md#2026-10-04---dev-database-migration-catch-up) | Retarget with an appropriate DEV runtime credential; do not infer runtime login from SET ROLE/admin inspection. |

The owner was asked to complete credential entry/submission in Render. Computer-use requires handoff before changing authentication credentials; no new DB secret was entered. Secret values and full connection strings are absent from this evidence. No Render setting or deployment was changed.

## Scope and source

- Source of decisions: `GotIt-Consolidated-Review-and-Development-Spec-HE-v1.1.md`
  in the owner's `gotit-ux-v2-2026-10-05` delivery, superseding 2.0.
- Editable design: [Figma 2.1](https://www.figma.com/design/kgMHTv0q4TJdwxCHYzUnSM/GotIt-UX?node-id=56-2).
- Motion reference: owner-supplied `GotIt-Animations/GotIt-Animations.html`.
- Delivery branch: `feat/ux-2-1-dev`. **Do not merge or push this release to main**:
  production follows main. This request authorizes DEV only.
- Existing Core, Backend, Chrome and database contracts are retained. No migration.

The 247 canonical design states are review variants, not 247 independent features.
This checkpoint does **not** certify every variant as an independently implemented
server capability or every legacy screen as a pixel-exact design replica.

## Important behavior and limits

- Target, translation/support and UI languages are separate. The alphabet follows
  each server study card's language pair, not `prompt.languageCode` or a guessed
  English default. Ordinary writing retains only language metadata from study.
- Languages without a defined alphabet keep native text/IME input; they do not
  receive an unrelated letter keyboard. Letter clicks and native typing submit the
  same existing `answerText`; scores/scheduling/XP remain server-owned.
- Library return URL carries bounded presentation context, never resource authority.
  Preparation drafts are session-local, validated, user/application/language/course
  scoped and expire after 30 minutes. They are not lesson sessions or evidence.
- Replay synthesizes the **same transcript text using browser TTS**. It is not an
  archived recording of the teacher's original audio. Native voice availability
  varies; unsupported replay reports unavailable. Existing support-language
  translation uses the provider contract and does not advance a fabricated task.
- A teacher without microphone is not supported by the existing contract. The UI
  labels its alternative as independent written word practice, not text AI teaching.
- Guided task/stage snapshots, billing pause, durable voice-session resume,
  readiness-based teacher stations, per-skill channel capabilities, native Android
  sharing/billing and new reward economies remain separate proposed extensions.
- Hebrew/English new UX copy is authored. Root navigation is localized for the
  other six existing UI locales; many new helper strings use English fallback.
- Motion uses entry/fade/sheet/press/letter/feedback/XP/recording cues from the supplied
  reference. Existing teacher audio-driven animation is preserved; decorative
  timing never produces learning evidence. Reduced motion and game effects-off
  suppress movement while preserving feedback/actions.

## Verification and DEV release gate

Run `npm.cmd run check` and `npm.cmd run test:responsive -- --workers=4`.
Regressions cover hidden alphabet metadata in ordinary games, multilingual letters,
IME fallback, repeating letters, grouped spaces/capacity, stable article-publication
retry, context restoration, expired/cross-owner drafts, mobile navigation/focus,
course approvals/versioning, actual provider event fixtures and touch scrolling.
Browser fixtures intercept API calls; they do not prove real provider, microphone,
database or billing acceptance. Physical-device/zoom/screen-reader acceptance remains
separate from automated viewport coverage.

**Server deployment is blocked at this checkpoint.** Read-only Render inspection
confirmed that `gotIt-dev-backend` still uses the production database. The separate
`gotit_dev` database exists and its prior migration catch-up is documented in the
specification, but a direct DEV runtime credential was not verified. Do not perform
product mutations through this DEV service until it is retargeted and isolation is
verified. No production service/environment/database was changed for this release.

Read-only inspection also confirmed that Core DEV uses `gotit_dev` and that DEV Web's
Core/Backend proxy targets and public origin all point to their DEV services. Core's
existing connection uses the DEV administrator role; this task changed no credential
or database privilege. Backend isolation remains the deployment blocker.

After the owner completes the credential handoff, verify DEV Backend/Core runtime
database targets and readiness, configure only DEV Web to this release branch,
check `CORE_API_PROXY_TARGET`, `GOTIT_API_PROXY_TARGET` and `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN`, deploy
the exact commit and smoke authenticated learning against isolated DEV data.
The Vite fallback proxies point at production: for local manual work set explicit
safe targets; the automated tests use intercepted APIs.

Rollback is a DEV-only deployment of the prior Web commit/branch. No database down
migration is required. Test evidence and final source SHA are tracked in the separate
this specification checkpoint.

## Traceability

FR-UX-001–006 map to UC-UX-01–04, SCR-02/03/04/09/10, SCR-PC-00A/B/01/02/03 and new SCR-UX-01/02/03. See catalogs and [SEQ-13](../uml/13-ux-context-reading.puml). No endpoint schema, provider, migration or learning/XP policy changed.
